The prototype is running on a Eufy C24.
It is quite simple to open without breaking, it holds together with plastic clips around the front where the white part meets the black. 
A spudging tool will open it easily. 
Remove the 4 screws at the back and pull the parts apart to get access to the lens.
The lens is held in place with glue that should disolve with isopropyl alcohol. 
Apply some with a cotton swab and wait. 
Then get some pliers and unscrew the lens making sure not to destroy the threads.
The new 25mm lens will screw in, but will be too long to put back together.
You can fix this with longer screws.

You will need to drill a hole through the middle of the peephole cover so the lens can see through it. 
Then secure it to the front webcam cover. I glued it on but it might make sense to have this be easily removable as there are 2 different sizes of peephole. 
The hotel I was at used the smaller ones. The large cover can be compressed to fit, but this leads to a slightly blurrier image. 


You won't need the front circuit board housing the IR lights, they aren't required and won't work anyway.
It doesn't hurt to leave it, but feel free to take it out. 

You'll need to adjust the focal length of the new lens so don't glue it back in. 
This is easier to do if you have access to a door viewer. 
Not all door viewers are identical so you may need to adjust this when you get to your hotel, as not all doors are the same thickness. 
This isn't easy if you've glued everything back together, and it's also difficult to get access to the lens with the camera installed in the peephole.
An improvement to the design would be to 3d print an adjustment arm that is threaded onto the lens. 

The travel router will connect to hotel wifi once you visit the bridging tab. It will prompt you to log into the portal. Once you do that it can then share that session with other devices through a new SSID.
This SSID is what the camera connects to.
